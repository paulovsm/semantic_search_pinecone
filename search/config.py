<Oval> Men who have an oval body type have slim shoulders and hips while the center of the body is wider, with the waist being the widest part of their frame. They tend to have short but broad limbs.

<Rectangle> The rectangle is also known as the slender body type. Men with this body shape have shoulders, waist, and hips in alignment. This means that they all have roughly the same width.

<Trapezoid> The trapezoid is a little similar in shape to that of the rectangle because the difference is very small. Men with this shape have broader shoulders and a wide chest while the waist is a just a little bit narrower. If you're not sure what is your body type, you can use a tape measure. It's also good to have a second pair of eyes.
